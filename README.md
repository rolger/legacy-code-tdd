# Legay Code TDD exercise

### As a attendee I want to add a new feature to the GildedRose

First, execute the approval tests (see ApprovalTest) and check the coverage of the Unit Tests 

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:
* "Conjured" items degrade in quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the updateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. The original requirements to the Gilded Rose can be found [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose)
